## Project Overview

Financial fraud continues to be one of the most significant threats to digital banking systems. As the volume of electronic transactions grows, detecting fraudulent activity quickly and accurately has become essential for financial institutions. This project develops a machine learning–based fraud detection system that analyzes transaction behavior and identifies suspicious activity in real time. By leveraging historical transaction data and behavioral patterns, the model learns to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The project applies a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, model training, and performance evaluation.

Two machine learning models were implemented and compared:
- **Logistic Regression** — Baseline linear classification model
- **Random Forest Classifier** — Advanced ensemble tree-based model

To address the common challenge of imbalanced fraud datasets, undersampling techniques were applied to ensure the model could effectively learn fraud patterns. Key transaction features such as transaction amount, transaction frequency, account balance behavior, and recent transaction patterns were used to train the models. The results demonstrate how machine learning can significantly improve fraud detection capabilities by identifying high-risk transactions while minimizing false positives. This project highlights how data-driven models can support financial institutions in preventing fraud, protecting customers, and improving transaction security.

---

## Project Objectives

The major goal of this capstone project is to build classification models that could be able to identify the patterns in the various transactions and train these models in order to predict the outcome of the transactions if they are fraud transactions or not. These models are built in an attempt to be deployed into real world data especially financial databases and be able to use the models that we build and train to immediately flag transactions who follow the same pattern of the transactions flagged as fraud and prevent future users from falling victims of fraud.

### Specific Objectives

- Detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning
- Analyze transaction behavior and spending patterns
- Handle imbalanced fraud datasets using resampling techniques
- Train and evaluate classification models for fraud
- Identify key transaction features that contribute to fraud detection

## Data Source and Justification

The dataset being used is a fraud detection dataset of users who carried out transactions using PaySim. PaySim is a financial simulator that simulates mobile money transactions based on an original dataset. Although the dataset was generated synthetically using PaySim, this dataset was chosen because of how well it relates with real world financial transactions and is also a very good dataset that works well with classification models. The dataset shows transactions that were tagged as fraud and those that were legitimate. It is a large dataset containing 5,420,481 rows and 27 columns sourced from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chendoytshman/fraud-detection-paysim)

## Methodology

### Stage 1 — Data Cleaning and Preparation

The project began with loading the dataset containing 5,420,481 transaction records across 27 columns. The first step was memory optimization — a custom heuristic downcasting function was applied that converted 64-bit data types to their smallest valid equivalents (int8, int16, float32), reducing the dataset memory footprint by 57.4% from 1,116 MB down to 475 MB, making the 5.4 million record dataset computationally manageable for all downstream analysis. All 27 columns were renamed from cryptic original names to semantically descriptive labels — for example, `step` became `hour_of_simulation`, `action` became `transaction_type` and `nameOrig` became `sender_id` — establishing the semantic clarity that carried through every subsequent stage. Three redundant columns (`transaction_time_duplicate`, `time_merge_flag`, `rule_based_fraud_flag`) were dropped, and the only categorical text column `transaction_type` was label encoded into numerical values (CASH_IN=0, CASH_OUT=1, DEBIT=2, PAYMENT=3, TRANSFER=4). The dataset was confirmed to contain zero missing values and zero duplicate records across all 5.4 million rows, establishing it as a clean and structurally sound foundation for analysis.

---

### Stage 2 — Data Distribution

With the dataset cleaned, Stage 2 examined the distribution of every feature across both categorical and numerical dimensions. The most critical discovery was the severe class imbalance in the fraud label (target variable) where only 1.12% of transactions (60,666 records) are fraudulent while 98.88% (5,359,815 records) are legitimate. The transaction type analysis revealed that CASH_IN dominates the dataset at 41.6% of all transactions, followed by PAYMENT at 27.57%, CASH_OUT at 20.74%, TRANSFER at 6.73% and DEBIT at 3.31%. The `hour_of_simulation` column confirmed 720 unique values representing each hour of the 30-day simulation period and when grouped into weekly periods, Week 4 (Day 22–30) showed the highest transaction volume at 28.6%, foreshadowing the end-of-month fraud escalation discovered in Stage 3. Numerical analysis revealed that `transaction_amount` and all four rolling average amount columns are severely right-skewed and leptokurtic — `transaction_amount` alone has a skewness of 12.622 and kurtosis of 230.642 — confirming that the majority of transactions are small while a small number of extremely large transactions create heavy right tails, a distribution shape that reflects real-world fraud behavior.

---

### Stage 3 — Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Stage 3 produced the most decisive analytical discoveries of the entire project, each one directly shaping the feature selection and model design decisions in Stage 4. The countplot of fraud by transaction type revealed that fraud is exclusively concentrated in TRANSFER (8.3% fraud rate) and CASH_OUT (2.7% fraud rate), while CASH_IN, PAYMENT and DEBIT show a 0.0% fraud rate — indicating a classic Drain-and-Exit fraud workflow where funds are moved via TRANSFER then extracted via CASH_OUT. The violin and KDE plots confirmed that the average fraudulent transaction amount (2,757,426) is 22.5 times larger than the average legitimate transaction amount (122,719), with this gap persisting consistently across all four rolling time windows (1hr, 1day, 7days, 30days). The scatter plot of `sender_balance_before` against `transaction_amount` revealed the most striking fraud signature in the dataset — fraudulent transactions form a near-perfect diagonal line, meaning fraudsters systematically send amounts proportional to their entire available balance regardless of account size. The mule account analysis identified 4,937 receiver accounts that received more than one fraudulent transfer — with the most active used 19 times — confirming an organised fraud network rather than isolated incidents. The correlation heatmap revealed severe multicollinearity among the rolling average features (0.93–0.96 with each other) and identified `avg_amount_last_30days` (corr=0.70) and `transaction_amount` (corr=0.60) as the strongest linear fraud predictors. Finally, the weekly fraud distribution confirmed a statistically significant end-of-month escalation with Week 4 reaching 29.78% fraud concentration compared to 22–24% in Weeks 1–3.

---

### Stage 4 — Data Preprocessing

Building directly on the evidence from Stage 3, Stage 4 translated all analytical findings into a precise, model-ready dataset. Six features were selected — `transaction_amount`, `avg_amount_last_30days`, `transaction_type_encoded`, `total_sent_last_1hr`, `receiver_balance_after` and `week_group_encoded` — based on correlation strength, absence of multicollinearity and domain-level interpretability. Features with severe redundancy were excluded, including the three other avg_amount columns (0.93–0.96 correlation with `avg_amount_last_30days`), `sender_balance_before` (0.94 correlation with `sender_balance_after`) and `row_id`/`hour_of_simulation` (perfect 1.00 correlation with each other). The dataset was split 80/20 using stratified sampling with random_state=42, preserving the 1.12% fraud rate in both partitions — producing a training set of 4,336,384 and a test set of 1,084,097. Random undersampling was applied exclusively to the training set, randomly reducing the 4,287,851 non-fraud records to match the 48,533 fraud records, producing a perfectly balanced training set of 97,066 samples. The test set was deliberately left at its original imbalanced distribution to accurately simulate real-world deployment conditions. StandardScaler was fitted exclusively on the balanced training set and used to transform both the training and test sets, ensuring mean=0 and std=1 across all 6 features.

#### Train-Test Split

| Split | Total Samples | Non-Fraud (0) | Fraud (1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Training (80%) | 4,336,384 | 4,287,851 | 48,533 |
| Testing (20%) | 1,084,097 | 1,071,964 | 12,133 |

#### Selected Features

| Feature | Correlation | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `transaction_amount` | 0.60 | Fraud avg = 2.75M vs 122K legitimate — core signal |
| `avg_amount_last_30days` | 0.70 | Strongest single predictor — 15-20x higher in fraud |
| `transaction_type_encoded` | 0.08 | TRANSFER=8.3% fraud, CASH_OUT=2.7% — decisive channel split |
| `total_sent_last_1hr` | 0.48 | Short-window velocity captures burst fraud spending patterns |
| `receiver_balance_after` | low | Account flooding pattern confirmed in Stage 3 |
| `week_group_encoded` | 0.01 | Non-linear end-of-month surge — retained on domain evidence |

---

### Stage 5 — Machine Learning

Two classification models were built and evaluated — Logistic Regression (baseline) and Random Forest (advanced) — alongside a Grid Search CV hyperparameter optimization, all trained on the balanced undersampled training set of 97,066 samples from Stage 4.

The **Logistic Regression** model was configured with strong L2 regularization (C=0.05) to prevent the large-magnitude features — particularly `avg_amount_last_30days` and `transaction_amount` — from dominating the decision boundary. It achieved a train accuracy of 95.80%, test accuracy of 98.98% and test recall of 92.58%, correctly catching 11,233 out of 12,133 fraud cases. The test precision of 52.49% and F1 of 67.00% reflect the expected challenge of a linear model applied to a non-linear, imbalanced fraud problem. Feature coefficients confirmed every Stage 3 finding — `avg_amount_last_30days` led at +10.293, `transaction_amount` followed at +7.228, and `week_group_encoded` at +0.680 validated the end-of-month temporal signal despite its near-zero Pearson correlation.

#### Logistic Regression — Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Train | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 95.80% | 98.98% |
| Precision | 99.02% | 52.49% |
| Recall | 92.51% | 92.58% |
| F1 Score | 95.66% | 67.00% |

#### Logistic Regression — Confusion Matrix (Test Set)

| | Predicted Non-Fraud | Predicted Fraud |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual Non-Fraud** | 1,061,798 | 10,166 |
| **Actual Fraud** | 900 | 11,233 |

#### Logistic Regression — Feature Importance (Coefficients)

| Feature | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `avg_amount_last_30days` | +10.293 | Strongest fraud predictor — dominant rolling average signal |
| `transaction_amount` | +7.228 | Second most powerful — consistent with corr=0.60 |
| `week_group_encoded` | +0.680 | Validates end-of-month fraud escalation |
| `transaction_type_encoded` | +0.314 | TRANSFER and CASH_OUT weighted toward fraud |
| `total_sent_last_1hr` | -0.280 | Non-fraud users transact more frequently in short windows |
| `receiver_balance_after` | -1.274 | Legitimate transactions increase receiver balance normally |

---

The **Random Forest** outperformed Logistic Regression across every fraud-specific metric. Configured with n_estimators=100, max_depth=8 and min_samples_leaf=50 to prevent overfitting, it achieved a test recall of 97.50% and F1 of 71.46% — reducing false negatives from 900 to just 303 and false positives from 10,166 to 9,146 compared to Logistic Regression. Feature importance by Gini impurity ranked `transaction_amount` first at 42.54%, `avg_amount_last_30days` second at 26.39%, `total_sent_last_1hr` third at 17.55%, `transaction_type_encoded` fourth at 9.95%, `receiver_balance_after` fifth at 3.23% and `week_group_encoded` last at 0.34% — validating all feature selection decisions from Stage 4 and confirming that the behavioral fraud patterns discovered in Stages 2 and 3 translated directly into model-level predictive power.

#### Random Forest — Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Train | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 98.40% | 98.98% |
| Precision | 99.22% | 56.40% |
| Recall | 97.56% | 97.50% |
| F1 Score | 98.38% | 71.46% |

#### Random Forest — Confusion Matrix (Test Set)

| | Predicted Non-Fraud | Predicted Fraud |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual Non-Fraud** | 1,062,818 | 9,146 |
| **Actual Fraud** | 303 | 11,830 |

#### Random Forest — Feature Importance (Gini Impurity)

| Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `transaction_amount` | 42.54% | Dominant splitter — most important by Gini across 100 trees |
| `avg_amount_last_30days` | 26.39% | Rolling average confirms sustained high-amount fraud behavior |
| `total_sent_last_1hr` | 17.55% | Velocity signal captures burst fraud activity |
| `transaction_type_encoded` | 9.95% | Channel type creates clear TRANSFER/CASH_OUT splits |
| `receiver_balance_after` | 3.23% | Balance flooding signal — moderate contribution |
| `week_group_encoded` | 0.34% | Temporal grouping — marginal Gini reduction |

The **Grid Search CV** evaluated 162 parameter combinations across 486 model fits using ROC-AUC as the scoring metric, identifying the optimal configuration as max_depth=10, min_samples_leaf=25, min_samples_split=50, n_estimators=100 and max_features='sqrt'. This achieved a best cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.9993, improving fraud precision to 0.60, recall to 0.98 and F1 to 0.75 — confirming that the baseline Random Forest parameters were near-optimal while delivering meaningful operational improvements that make the Grid Search optimised Random Forest the recommended production model.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Recommendations

Based on the findings of the analysis, the organisation should strengthen its fraud prevention framework by focusing on the most significant risk indicators identified in the dataset.

- **Real-time velocity monitoring** should be implemented so that transactions associated with unusually high values of `total_sent_last_1hr` — particularly those above the 75th percentile threshold of 304,943 — trigger immediate secondary authentication. This is necessary because rapid spending within a short period emerged as the strongest short-term fraud signal.

- **TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions** should be subjected to stricter verification procedures. Given their fraud rates of 8.3% and 2.7% respectively, these transaction types present greater exposure to fraudulent activity, especially where the transaction amount is close to the sender's available balance. Measures such as one-time passwords or biometric confirmation would help reduce this risk.

- **End-of-month fraud response measures** should be adopted. Since Week 4 recorded the highest fraud concentration at 29.78% compared with 22–24% in earlier weeks, fraud monitoring systems should be more sensitive and investigation teams better prepared during the final seven days of each month.

- **Repeat receiver accounts linked to fraud** should be continuously monitored. The 4,937 mule accounts identified in Stage 3 should be flagged in real time, and any transaction involving them should automatically prompt a fraud review.

- **Future model iterations** should include additional variables such as sender account age, device fingerprint consistency, and geographic velocity. These features would improve the model's ability to detect more complex fraud patterns not fully captured by the current six-feature model.

### Conclusion

The Capstone Project carried out by the members of Group 12 demonstrates a comprehensive fraud detection workflow that includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning model optimization. The analysis revealed key behavioral patterns within transaction data and highlighted the challenge of detecting fraud within highly imbalanced datasets. Exploratory analysis revealed that fraudulent activities occur primarily in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions, and that fraud cases are extremely rare compared to normal transactions. Visualization techniques further helped identify patterns and anomalies within the data. Through hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved improved performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potentially fraudulent transactions within the dataset.

These findings highlight the value of combining data analysis, visualization and machine learning to strengthen fraud detection systems in financial institutions. Such systems are essential for improving security in digital financial services and reducing the risk of financial fraud. Overall, the results show that machine learning models play an important role in improving fraud detection systems and helping financial institutions identify suspicious transactions more effectively.
